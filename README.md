2. Open `downloader.py` in your editor.
3. Set your **video code**:

   ```python
   VIDEO_CODE = "YOUR_VIDEO_CODE_HERE"
   ```

4. (Optional) Adjust `TOTAL_DURATION` if your video is longer than `120` seconds.
5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 downloader.py
   ```

6. The script will:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Inside `downloader.py` you can tweak:

- `VIDEO_CODE` ‚Üí Your unique video identifier
- `TOTAL_DURATION` ‚Üí Total video length in seconds (default: `120`)
- `SEGMENT_DURATION` ‚Üí How long each downloaded chunk is (default: `30`)

## üõ† How It Works

1. The script queries the **VT3 highlights API** for video chunks.
2. It downloads all parts into a temporary folder.
3. It generates a `file_list.txt` containing the clips.
4. ffmpeg concatenates the chunks into a seamless `output.mp4`.
